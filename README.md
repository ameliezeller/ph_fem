# Port-Hamiltonian Modeling of 3D Truss Structures and Frames
The code in this repository can be used to assemble 3D linear elastic mechanical port-Hamiltonian systems composed of beam and rod elements. 

A detailed explanation of the methods and algorithms employed will be available in form of a scientific paper after publication. Check here for updates. For now, please refer to the provided examples to learn about the usage of the framework. 

## Dependencies
The function [lgwt](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/4540-legendre-gauss-quadrature-weights-and-nodes) written by Greg von Winckel is used to compute the Gauss-Legendre quadrature weights and nodes.
It is included in the repository so there is no need to download it.
