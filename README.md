# Port-Hamiltonian Modeling of 3D Truss Structures and Frames
The code in this repository can be used to assemble 3D linear elastic mechanical port-Hamiltonian systems composed of beam and rod elements. 

A detailed explanation of the methods and algorithms employed will be available in form of a scientific paper after publication. Check here for updates. For now, please refer to the provided examples to learn about the usage of the framework.
